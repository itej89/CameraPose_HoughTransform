# Camera Pose estimation from a video

## Required libraries

please make sure to install following before executing the above code
```python
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install scikit-learn
pip3 install opencv-python==4.6.0
```
## Instructions to run the code
    Run "python3 Problem1.py"

## Implementation
The camera pose estimation from video is implemented as shown in the below pipeline

####  Choice of Real world coordinates:

* Real world axis is chosen at the center of the page with x-axis parallel to the
longer edge and y-axis parallel to the shorter edge

## Results
* Computed Camera Pose Estimation for over 150 frames of the given videos is as shown below. The code would take upto ~1min 10sec to process the video.
